# Weather Forecast

### Project goal

"Weather Forecast", developed as our 3rd year college project, is a program used for class "Human-Computer Interaction" in 2023. Main goal of the project was to familiarize with the WPF library, as well as getting to know how C# works.

### Project structure

The main goal of the project was to familiarize with interface design, so we opted for **WPF C#**, considering our next project was meant to be done in WPF too.

**API** that we used for this project was "https://www.weatherapi.com/". We used the free version which gives us weather info 2 days in advance. The icons themselves were taken from the website itself. 

For the chart itself, we used **LiveCharts** NuGet package. It's simple and easily scalable charts seemed like the perfect fit for our application.
